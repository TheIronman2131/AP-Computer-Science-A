# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a introductory level program using the first three units of AP Computer Science A. The exception to this is a switch case which has not been covered. However, if you would like to understand and learn
switch cases this code is written for you. This program will ask you to input one of three options, "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors." It is important that your respective choice is spelled correctly and the first
letter is capitalized. This could be combated in the future with one of the methods from the [APCSA Quick Reference Guide.](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf) Because this is a beginner program I have not opted to use caseIgnore and boolean operators when handling comparing user responses to the computer to the best of my abilty.

## Ease of Understanding
I have assigned a integar value to each of the three options. Scissors has the equivelent vaule of 0, Rock has the equivelent value of 1, and Paper has an equivelent value of 2. It was found while writing the program that the computer will always choose the same output as you if Math.Random() exceeds 2. 

## Depreciation
This program has served it's intended purpose and will not recieve further commits unless deemed truely nessary or a security vulnerability has been discovered. This program is prone to memory leaks. As a new programmer I have tried to limit the amound of memory the program uses at one time. However, because of the way Java is compiled your system may give it additional RAM or CPU power. None of which have any malicous intentions and there isn't anything I as the developer know a solution to. If I do learn of a solution this program will recieve it's final commit with that update. Until then check out my other work as I upload my homeworks, labs, projects, and additional projects I do for fun in my free time.
